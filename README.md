[![Shuttle Deploy](https://github.com/jeph/slowpoke/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jeph/slowpoke/actions/workflows/main.yml)

slowpoke is a custom bot for Discord I'm writing to force me to learn Rust. It is currently a work in progress.

## Setup

Refer to the `Secrets.dev.toml.example` file and create a version called `Secrets.dev.toml` with the required variables.

## Development

Run a local version of the bot:

```zsh
cargo shuttle run
```
